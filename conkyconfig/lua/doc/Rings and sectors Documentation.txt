--[[ RINGS with SECTORS widget
	v1.1 by wlourf (07 Jan. 2011)
	this widget draws a ring with differents effects 
	http://u-scripts.blogspot.com/2010/08/rings-sectors-widgets.html
	
To call the script in a conky, use, before TEXT
	lua_load /path/to/the/script/rings.lua
	lua_draw_hook_pre main_rings
and add one line (blank or not) after TEXT


Parameters are :
3 parameters are mandatory
name			- the name of the conky variable to display,
			  for example for {$cpu cpu0}, just write name="cpu"
arg			- the argument of the above variable,
			  for example for {$cpu cpu0}, just write arg="cpu0"
		  	  arg can be a numerical value if name=""
max			- the maximum value the above variable can reach,
			  for example for {$cpu cpu0}, just write max=100
	
Optional parameters:
xc,yc			- coordinates of the center of the ring,
			  default = middle of the conky window
radius			- external radius of the ring, in pixels,
			  default = quarter of the width of the conky window
thickness		- thickness of the ring, in pixels, default = 10 pixels
start_angle		- starting angle of the ring, in degrees, value can be negative,
			  default = 0 degree
end_angle		- ending angle of the ring, in degrees,
			  value must be greater than start_angle, default = 360 degrees
sectors			- number of sectors in the ring, default = 10
gap_sectors 		- gap between two sectors, in pixels, default = 1 pixel
cap			- the way to close a sector, available values are
				"p" for parallel , default value 
				"r" for radial (follow the radius)
inverse_arc		- if set to true, arc will be anticlockwise, default=false
border_size		- size of the border, in pixels, default = 0 pixel i.e. no border
fill_sector		- if set to true, each sector will be completely filled,
			  default=false, this parameter is inoperate if sectors=1
background		- if set to false, background will not be drawn, default=true
foreground		- if set to false, foreground will not be drawn, default=true

Colours tables below are defined into braces :
{position in the gradient (0 to 1), colour in hexadecimal, alpha (0 to 1)}
example for a single colour table : 
{{0,0xFFAA00,1}} position parameter doesn't matter
example for a two-colours table : 
{{0,0xFFAA00,1},{1,0x00AA00,1}} or {{0.5,0xFFAA00,1},{1,0x00AA00,1}}
example for a three-colours table : 
{{0,0xFFAA00,1},{0.5,0xFF0000,1},{1,0x00AA00,1}}

bg_colour1	- colour table for background,
			  default = {{0,0x00ffff,0.1},{0.5,0x00FFFF,0.5},{1,0x00FFFF,0.1}}
fg_colour1	- colour table for foreground,
			  default = {{0,0x00FF00,0.1},{0.5,0x00FF00,1},{1,0x00FF00,0.1}}
bd_colour1	- colour table for border,
			  default = {{0,0xFFFF00,0.5},{0.5,0xFFFF00,1},{1,0xFFFF00,0.5}}			  

Seconds tables for radials gradients :
bg_colour2	- second colour table for background, default = no second colour
fg_colour2	- second colour table for foreground, default = no second colour
bd_colour2	- second colour table for border, default = no second colour

draw_me     	- if set to false, text is not drawn (default = true or 1)
             	 it can be used with a conky string, if the string returns 1, the text is drawn :
              	 example : "${if_empty ${wireless_essid wlan0}}${else}1$endif",

v1.0 (08 Aug. 2010) original release
v1.1 (07 Jan. 2011) Add draw_me parameter and correct memory leaks, thanks to "Creamy Goodness"
                    text is parsed inside the function, not in the array of settings
